# SimpleVideoPlayer Loading Fix

## Problem
The video player was stuck in loading state even after the stream URL was successfully extracted. The console showed:
- ✅ Stream extraction successful
- ✅ Proxy URL set correctly
- ❌ "Loading state still TRUE - waiting for video ready..."
- ❌ "Video setup skipped" (repeated)

## Root Cause
The loading state (`setLoading(false)`) was only being cleared when specific video events fired (`canplay`, `playing`), but if the video element wasn't properly initialized or these events didn't fire, the loading spinner would stay forever.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Added Loading Timeout (30 seconds)
```javascript
const loadingTimeout = setTimeout(() => {
  console.error('⏰ [DEBUG] Video loading timeout - forcing loading state to false');
  setLoading(false);
  setError('Video loading timeout. The stream may be unavailable.');
}, 30000);
```

### 2. Clear Loading on HLS Manifest Parsed
```javascript
hls.on(window.Hls.Events.MANIFEST_PARSED, () => {
  console.log('📋 [DEBUG] HLS manifest parsed successfully');
  setLoading(false); // ← Added this
});
```

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
```javascript
hls.on(window.Hls.Events.ERROR, (event, data) => {
  if (data.fatal) {
    clearTimeout(loadingTimeout); // ← Clear timeout on error
    setError(`HLS playback error: ${data.details || data.type}`);
    setLoading(false);
  }
});
```

### 4. Better Logging
Added comprehensive logging to track the video setup flow.

## Expected Behavior
- Loading spinner shows while extracting stream
- Loading spinner clears when HLS manifest is parsed OR video can play
- If loading takes >30 seconds, timeout error is shown
- User can retry or go back
