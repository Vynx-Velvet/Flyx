# SimpleVideoPlayer Loading Fix

## Problem
The video player was stuck in loading state even after the stream URL was successfully extracted. The console showed:
- ‚úÖ Stream extraction successful
- ‚úÖ Proxy URL set correctly
- ‚ùå "Loading state still TRUE - waiting for video ready..."
- ‚ùå "Video setup skipped" (repeated twice)

## Root Causes
1. **Video Element Not Rendered**: The loading screen was shown when `loading === true`, which prevented the video element from being rendered. The video setup effect would run but couldn't find `videoRef.current`.

2. **Loading State Not Cleared**: The loading state was only cleared when specific video events fired (`canplay`, `playing`), but these events never fired because the video element didn't exist.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. **CRITICAL FIX: Changed Loading Condition**
```javascript
// Before: if (loading) { return <LoadingScreen /> }
// After:
if (loading && !streamUrl) {
  return <LoadingScreen />
}
```
This ensures the video element is rendered as soon as we have a stream URL, even if loading is still true.

### 2. Added Video Loading Overlay
Shows a loading overlay on top of the video player while HLS is initializing:
```javascript
{loading && streamUrl && (
  <motion.div>Initializing Video Player...</motion.div>
)}
```

### 3. Added Loading Timeout (30 seconds)
```javascript
const loadingTimeout = setTimeout(() => {
  console.error('‚è∞ [DEBUG] Video loading timeout - forcing loading state to false');
  setLoading(false);
  setError('Video loading timeout. The stream may be unavailable.');
}, 30000);
```

### 4. Clear Loading on HLS Manifest Parsed
```javascript
hls.on(window.Hls.Events.MANIFEST_PARSED, () => {
  console.log('üìã [DEBUG] HLS manifest parsed successfully');
  setLoading(false); // ‚Üê Added this
});
```

### 5. Enhanced Error Handling
```javascript
hls.on(window.Hls.Events.ERROR, (event, data) => {
  if (data.fatal) {
    clearTimeout(loadingTimeout); // ‚Üê Clear timeout on error
    setError(`HLS playback error: ${data.details || data.type}`);
    setLoading(false);
  }
});
```

### 6. Better Logging
Added comprehensive logging to track the video setup flow.

## Expected Behavior
- Loading spinner shows while extracting stream
- Loading spinner clears when HLS manifest is parsed OR video can play
- If loading takes >30 seconds, timeout error is shown
- User can retry or go back
