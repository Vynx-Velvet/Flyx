              <h2>The Origin Story: "How Hard Could It Be?" ü§°</h2>
              <p className="mission-text">
                It all started with a simple question: "Why do all these streaming sites look like they were designed in 2003 and have more ads than a NASCAR car?" We thought, "Hey, how hard could it be to make a clean streaming platform?" 
              </p>
              <p className="mission-text">
                <strong>Narrator:</strong> <em>It was, in fact, very hard.</em>
              </p>
              <p className="mission-text">
                What began as a weekend project quickly turned into a months-long journey through the seventh circle of web development hell. We discovered that the streaming world is basically the Wild West, except everyone's wearing a trench coat and whispering about "embed.su" in dark corners of Discord servers.
              </p>
              <p className="mission-text">
                Our mission was simple: create a platform that doesn't try to install 47 browser extensions, mine Bitcoin on your GPU, or redirect you to "Hot Singles in Your Area" every time you breathe near the play button. Turns out, this was revolutionary thinking in the streaming world.

              <h2>The Development Journey: A Comedy of Errors üò≠</h2>
              <p className="mission-text">
                <strong>Month 1: "This Should Take a Week"</strong><br/>
                We started with the confidence of a junior developer who just learned React. "We'll just scrape some URLs, proxy them, and boom - Netflix killer!" The first attempt involved a simple fetch request that immediately got smacked down by CORS faster than a fly hitting a windshield.
              </p>
              <p className="mission-text">
                <strong>Month 2: "Okay, Maybe We Need a Backend"</strong><br/>
                Enter Playwright, our knight in shining armor... that occasionally decided to crash for no reason. We spent countless hours debugging headless browsers that worked perfectly until we added one tiny console.log, then suddenly acted like they'd never seen JavaScript before. The browser would literally sit there like "¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø" while we screamed at our monitors.
              </p>
              <p className="mission-text">
                <strong>Month 3: "Why Is Everything Obfuscated?"</strong><br/>
                We discovered that streaming sites protect their URLs with obfuscation so thick you need a machete to cut through it. Variables named like someone fell asleep on their keyboard, functions that call functions that call more functions just to decrypt "potato".
              </p>
              <p className="mission-text">
                <strong>Month 4: "The CORS Wars"</strong><br/>
                CORS became our nemesis. We tried everything: monkey-patching fetch, bribing the browser security gods, even whispering sweet nothings to our HTTP headers. Finally, we built a proxy that basically acts like a diplomatic translator between angry streaming servers and confused browsers.
              </p>
              <p className="mission-text">
                <strong>Month 5: "It Works! ...Sometimes"</strong><br/>
                Success! Sort of. It worked perfectly on our machines, but broke spectacularly in production. The classic developer experience: "Well, it works in dev environment" became our motto. Turns out VM networking is different from localhost. Who knew? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
              </p>
              <p className="mission-text">
                <strong>Month 6: "Polish and Panic"</strong><br/>
                Adding subtitles seemed simple until we realized there are approximately 47 different subtitle formats, each with their own special way of timing text. SRT files that claim to be UTF-8 but are actually encoded in some ancient Babylonian character set. VTT files that work everywhere except the one browser your users actually use.

                  <h3>The Great Bot Detection Wars</h3>
                  <p>Turns out, streaming sites really don't like robots. They detect everything: your user agent, your screen resolution, how you move your mouse, probably your astrological sign. We had to make our bot act more human than actual humans.</p>
                  <p className="process-detail"><strong>The Reality:</strong> We spent 3 weeks making Playwright move the mouse in "realistic" patterns. Our bot was doing little mouse dances, random scrolls, even fake typos. It had more personality than some of our friends.</p>
                  <p className="process-detail"><strong>The Breakthrough:</strong> The secret wasn't being more human - it was being consistently inconsistent. Real humans are chaotically imperfect. Our bot learned to be beautifully, randomly flawed.</p>

                  <h3>CORS: The Gatekeeper From Hell</h3>
                  <p>CORS errors became our sleep paralysis demon. "Access to fetch has been blocked by CORS policy" haunted our dreams. We tried everything short of sacrificing a rubber duck to the browser gods.</p>
                  <p className="process-detail"><strong>The Madness:</strong> We built 4 different proxy approaches. One used reverse proxying, another tried header spoofing, one attempted to sweet-talk the browser with promises of good behavior. None worked consistently.</p>
                  <p className="process-detail"><strong>The Solution:</strong> We finally built a smart proxy that doesn't just forward requests - it reads M3U8 playlists like a bedtime story and rewrites every URL in real-time. It's basically a URL translator with anger management issues.</p>

                  <h3>JavaScript Obfuscation: The Puzzle From Hell</h3>
                  <p>Streaming sites protect their URLs with obfuscation so thick you need a machete to cut through it. Variables named like someone fell asleep on their keyboard, functions that call functions that call more functions just to decrypt "potato".</p>
                  <p className="process-detail"><strong>The Nightmare:</strong> We found URLs buried 17 layers deep in obfuscated JavaScript. Base64 inside URL encoding inside more base64 inside a function that only runs if the moon is in the right phase and you've clicked exactly 3 times.</p>
                  <p className="process-detail"><strong>The Eureka Moment:</strong> Instead of trying to reverse-engineer the obfuscation, we let the browser do it for us. We execute the code in a sandbox and catch the good stuff when it tries to escape. Lazy? Yes. Effective? Also yes.</p>

                  <h3>The M3U8 Playlist Madness</h3>
                  <p>M3U8 files are like IKEA instructions - they look simple until you try to follow them. Each playlist can link to more playlists, creating an infinite Russian doll situation that made us question our life choices.</p>
                  <p className="process-detail"><strong>The Chaos:</strong> Some playlists had relative URLs, others had absolute URLs, some had URLs that only work if you ask nicely. Quality levels that lie about their resolution. Segments that expire faster than milk in summer.</p>
                  <p className="process-detail"><strong>The Fix:</strong> We built a parser that's basically a psychic - it predicts what the playlist author meant to do, not what they actually did. It can handle broken timestamps, missing headers, and URLs that lead to 404 pages.</p>

                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>VM Isolation:</strong> Every request gets its own VM because we learned the hard way that browsers hold grudges. One bad request can poison the whole session, like that one friend who ruins the vibe at parties.</li>
                    <li><strong>Serverless Everything:</strong> We went serverless because we're too lazy to manage servers. Vercel handles the scaling while we handle the existential crises. It's a good division of labor.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Proxy System:</strong> Our proxy is like a translator who's fluent in "angry server" and "confused browser." It rewrites URLs faster than a politician rewrites their campaign promises.</li>
                    <li><strong>Subtitle Integration:</strong> We integrated with OpenSubtitles because life's too short to watch movies without knowing what anyone is saying. Plus, their API documentation is actually readable, which is rarer than you'd think.</li>
                    <li><strong>Caching Strategy:</strong> We cache everything except our mistakes (we made too many of those). Multiple layers of caching because nothing hurts more than waiting 30 seconds for a stream that doesn't work.</li>

                    <li><strong>Header Randomization:</strong> Our bots have more fake identities than a spy movie. They rotate user agents, randomize headers, and probably have trust issues by now.</li>
                    <li><strong>Human Behavior Simulation:</strong> Teaching browsers to act human was like teaching your dad to use TikTok - painful but necessary. Our bots now scroll with the perfect amount of laziness.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rate Limiting:</strong> We're polite robots. We don't spam servers like that person who sends 47 texts in a row. Nobody likes that person, including servers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Error Handling:</strong> Our error handling has error handling. It's error handling all the way down. We've seen things break in ways that shouldn't be physically possible.</li>

                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Multi-Layer Caching:</strong> We cache so aggressively it borders on hoarding. Browser cache, CDN cache, application cache, probably emotional cache too. Cache is love, cache is life.</li>
                    <li><strong>Real-Time Updates:</strong> The frontend gets live updates during extraction like a sports commentator calling a game. "And here we see the browser navigating to the embed page... OH! A wild CAPTCHA appears!"</li>
                    <li><strong>Smart Fallbacks:</strong> When our primary source fails, we switch to backups faster than a politician changes positions during election season. Seamless failure is an art form.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resource Management:</strong> We manage browser instances like a helicopter parent. Every resource is tracked, every memory leak is hunted down like it owes us money.</li>
                    <li><strong>Global Distribution:</strong> Thanks to Vercel's edge network, our suffering is available worldwide! Users in Tokyo can experience the same CORS errors as users in New York. True global equality.</li>

                    <li><strong>Quality Detection:</strong> Our system can identify video quality like a wine sommelier identifies vintages. "Ah yes, this is a fine 720p with hints of compression artifacts and a robust buffering profile."</li>
                    <li><strong>Subtitle Processing:</strong> Converting SRT to VTT shouldn't be rocket science, but here we are. Different subtitle formats have more personality disorders than reality TV stars.</li>
                    <li><strong>Adaptive Streaming:</strong> The player automatically adjusts quality based on your internet speed, which is more consideration than most streaming services give you.</li>

              <p className="mission-text">
                If you're thinking about building something similar, here's what we learned so you don't have to suffer as much as we did.
              </p>
              <p className="mission-text">
                <strong>Lesson 1: CORS is Not Your Friend</strong><br/>
                CORS will betray you when you least expect it. Build your proxy system first, not last. Trust us, we learned this the hard way after rebuilding our entire architecture twice.
              </p>
              <p className="mission-text">
                <strong>Lesson 2: Browsers Have Trust Issues</strong><br/>
                Modern browsers are more paranoid than a conspiracy theorist at an alien convention. Every security update breaks something new. Embrace the chaos, become one with the breakage.
              </p>
              <p className="mission-text">
                <strong>Lesson 3: Documentation is a Myth</strong><br/>
                Most streaming APIs have documentation that's about as useful as a chocolate teapot. You'll spend more time reverse-engineering than actually coding. Pack snacks for the journey.
              </p>
              <p className="mission-text">
                <strong>Lesson 4: Murphy's Law is an Understatement</strong><br/>
                Everything that can go wrong will go wrong, and some things that shouldn't be able to go wrong will find creative new ways to break. Embrace the absurdity.
              </p>
              <p className="mission-text">
                <strong>Lesson 5: Pacific Punch Monster Energy is a Necessary Dependency</strong><br/>
                Make sure to add caffeine to your package.json. It's not listed as a dev dependency, but it definitely should be. Our entire system runs on Pacific Punch Monster Energy and determination. We went through approximately 6 cans per day during active development - that's 1,643 cans total. The gas station clerk now knows us by name.
              </p>
              <p className="mission-text">
                <strong>Lesson 6: Error Messages Are Suggestions</strong><br/>
                That "Network Error" could mean literally anything from DNS issues to cosmic radiation. Build your error handling like you're preparing for an alien invasion - expect the unexpected and have backup plans for your backup plans.
              </p>
              <p className="mission-text">
                <strong>Lesson 7: The Browser is Your Frenemy</strong><br/>
                Browsers will work perfectly for 99.9% of users, then completely break for that one person using Internet Explorer on Windows Vista. Yes, that person still exists, and they will find your website.

                Because apparently we enjoy pain, here's what we're planning to add next. Each feature comes with its own unique opportunities for despair!
              </p>
              <p className="mission-text">
                <strong>AI Integration:</strong> Teaching machines to find streams because humans clearly aren't masochistic enough. Machine learning models that can detect "good" streaming links vs "definitely malware" links with 73% accuracy (better than us).
              </p>
              <p className="mission-text">
                <strong>Better Mobile Support:</strong> Making the mobile experience less painful. Currently our mobile app works about as well as a chocolate firewall, so there's room for improvement.
              </p>
              <p className="mission-text">
                <strong>More Streaming Sources:</strong> Adding more sources because we apparently enjoy the challenge of reverse-engineering new forms of digital sadness. Each new source is like a puzzle designed by someone who doesn't like us very much.
              </p>
              <p className="mission-text">
                <strong>Community Features:</strong> User accounts, watchlists, recommendations. You know, all the features that require databases and user management and other things that keep developers awake at night.

                <p>
                  <strong>This is educational content, folks!</strong> We built this to prove it was possible, not to overthrow the streaming industrial complex. Think of it as a very expensive science experiment that occasionally plays movies.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We're not trying to compete with Netflix, we just wanted to see if we could build something that doesn't assault your eyeballs with pop-ups every 3 seconds. Apparently, this was considered revolutionary thinking.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Technical Demonstration Only:</strong> This project exists to showcase what's possible with modern web technologies when you have too much time and not enough sense. The real streaming services have lawyers; we have coffee and determination.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>No Malware, We Promise:</strong> Unlike 99% of streaming sites, we don't try to install mysterious browser extensions or mine cryptocurrency on your laptop. We're rebels like that.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If anyone from the streaming sites is reading this: we're impressed by your security measures. They gave us many interesting debugging challenges and contributed significantly to our caffeine addiction. Thank you for the educational experience!
