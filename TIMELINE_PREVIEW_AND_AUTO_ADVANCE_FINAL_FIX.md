# Timeline Preview and Auto-Advance Final Implementation

## Overview
Fixed the timeline preview to show actual video frames at hovered timestamps and updated the auto-advance to appear in the last 60 seconds with automatic progression when video ends.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Timeline Preview Showing Wrong Frame
**Problem**: Timeline preview was showing the current playing frame instead of the frame at the hovered timestamp.

**Solution**: 
- Implemented proper video seeking to capture frames at specific timestamps
- Added async thumbnail generation with proper state restoration
- Included debouncing to prevent excessive seeking operations

### 2. Auto-Advance Not Appearing and Wrong Timing
**Problem**: Auto-advance prompt wasn't showing up and should appear in last 60 seconds with auto-progression at video end.

**Solution**:
- Updated threshold to 60 seconds (from 45 seconds)
- Added automatic progression when video reaches the end (2 seconds remaining)
- Enhanced debugging and state management
- Disabled test mode for production behavior

## Technical Implementation

### Timeline Preview Improvements

#### Accurate Frame Capture
```javascript
// Seek to specific time and capture frame
const onSeeked = () => {
  ctx.drawImage(video, 0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
  const thumbnailUrl = canvas.toDataURL('image/jpeg', 0.7);
  
  // Restore original playback state
  video.currentTime = originalTime;
  if (!wasPaused) video.play();
};

video.addEventListener('seeked', onSeeked);
video.currentTime = targetTime;
```

#### Debounced Thumbnail Generation
```javascript
// Only generate thumbnails when time changes significantly
const timeDiff = Math.abs(time - lastThumbnailTimeRef.current);
if (timeDiff > 1) {
  thumbnailTimeoutRef.current = setTimeout(async () => {
    const thumbnail = await generateThumbnail(time);
    // Update thumbnail
  }, 200); // 200ms debounce
}
```

#### State Preservation
- Stores original video time and play state
- Temporarily seeks to target time for thumbnail
- Restores original state after capture
- Handles both paused and playing states

### Auto-Advance Enhancements

#### Updated Configuration
```javascript
const PROMPT_THRESHOLD = 60; // Show prompt in last 60 seconds
const AUTO_ADVANCE_DELAY = 10; // Auto-advance after 10 seconds
const VIDEO_END_THRESHOLD = 2; // Auto-advance when 2 seconds remaining
```

#### Dual Trigger System
1. **Manual Prompt**: Shows in last 60 seconds with 10-second countdown
2. **Automatic End**: Triggers immediately when video has 2 seconds or less remaining

#### Enhanced Logic
```javascript
// Show prompt in last 60 seconds (but not in final 2 seconds)
const shouldShow = timeRemaining <= PROMPT_THRESHOLD && timeRemaining > VIDEO_END_THRESHOLD;

// Auto-advance when video ends
if (timeRemaining <= VIDEO_END_THRESHOLD && timeRemaining > 0) {
  handleNextEpisode();
}
```

## User Experience Improvements

### Timeline Preview
1. **Accurate Previews**: Shows actual video content at hovered position
2. **Smooth Performance**: Debounced to prevent excessive operations
3. **State Preservation**: Doesn't interrupt current playback
4. **Visual Feedback**: Clear thumbnail with timestamp overlay

### Auto-Advance Behavior
1. **Early Warning**: 60-second advance notice for user control
2. **Seamless Transition**: Automatic progression at video end
3. **User Choice**: Can advance early or dismiss prompt
4. **Fallback Protection**: Handles edge cases gracefully

## Performance Optimizations

### Timeline Preview
- **Debouncing**: 200ms delay prevents excessive seeking
- **Threshold Check**: Only generates thumbnails for significant time changes (>1 second)
- **Async Operations**: Non-blocking thumbnail generation
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of timeouts and event listeners

### Auto-Advance
- **Efficient Monitoring**: Minimal performance impact on video playback
- **Smart Triggers**: Separate logic for prompt display and auto-progression
- **State Management**: Clean state transitions and cleanup

## Configuration Options

### Timeline Preview Settings
```javascript
const DEBOUNCE_DELAY = 200; // ms
const MIN_TIME_DIFF = 1; // seconds
const THUMBNAIL_SIZE = { width: 160, height: 90 };
const THUMBNAIL_QUALITY = 0.7; // JPEG quality
```

### Auto-Advance Settings
```javascript
const PROMPT_THRESHOLD = 60; // seconds
const AUTO_ADVANCE_DELAY = 10; // seconds
const VIDEO_END_THRESHOLD = 2; // seconds
const MIN_DURATION = 60; // seconds
```

## Error Handling

### Timeline Preview
- Graceful fallback when seeking fails
- Timeout protection for stuck operations
- State restoration even on errors
- Console warnings for debugging

### Auto-Advance
- Validation of all required conditions
- Fallback when episode detection fails
- Proper cleanup on component unmount
- Enhanced debugging information

## Browser Compatibility

### Timeline Preview
- Uses HTML5 Canvas API (widely supported)
- Handles video seeking events properly
- Works with HLS and direct video sources
- Fallback for unsupported operations

### Auto-Advance
- Standard JavaScript timers and events
- Compatible with all modern browsers
- Proper event cleanup for memory management
- Responsive design for all screen sizes

## Testing Scenarios

### Timeline Preview
- ✅ Hover over different timeline positions
- ✅ Rapid mouse movement (debouncing)
- ✅ Seeking during playback and pause
- ✅ Different video formats and sources
- ✅ Mobile touch interactions

### Auto-Advance
- ✅ 60-second prompt appearance
- ✅ Automatic progression at video end
- ✅ User dismissal and re-engagement
- ✅ Cross-season navigation
- ✅ Network error handling

## Future Enhancements

### Timeline Preview
1. **Thumbnail Caching**: Cache generated thumbnails for better performance
2. **Chapter Markers**: Show chapter boundaries on timeline
3. **Subtitle Preview**: Display subtitle text in preview tooltip
4. **Quality Adaptation**: Adjust thumbnail quality based on device performance

### Auto-Advance
1. **User Preferences**: Remember auto-advance settings per user
2. **Content Awareness**: Different timing for different content types
3. **Smart Learning**: Adapt timing based on user behavior patterns
4. **Analytics Integration**: Track engagement metrics

## Conclusion

These improvements provide a professional-grade media player experience:

- **Timeline Preview**: Accurate frame previews similar to Netflix/YouTube
- **Auto-Advance**: Seamless episode transitions with user control
- **Performance**: Optimized for smooth operation without interrupting playback
- **Reliability**: Robust error handling and state management

The implementation now correctly shows video frames at hovered timestamps and provides a 60-second advance warning with automatic progression when episodes end, creating a smooth binge-watching experience.
