# Infinite Render Loop Fix

## Problem Identified

The FuturisticMediaPlayer component was stuck in an infinite re-render loop, causing:
- Constant HLS instance destruction and recreation
- Video setup effect triggering hundreds of times per second
- 403 Forbidden errors from the stream proxy
- Eventually losing the video ref, causing playback to fail

## Root Causes

### 1. **Aggressive State Watchers**
Multiple `useEffect` hooks were watching `playerState` properties and calling `forceStateSync` on every change:
- `playerState.isPlaying` watcher
- `playerState.currentTime` watcher
- `playerState.volume` watcher
- `playerState.isMuted` watcher
- `playerState.duration` watcher
- `playerState.isLoading` watcher

**Problem**: Each `forceStateSync` call updates `playerState`, which triggers the watchers again, creating an infinite loop.

### 2. **Excessive Continuous Sync**
A continuous sync interval running every 100ms was calling `forceStateSync`, which updates state, which triggers the watchers, creating more syncs.

### 3. **Unthrottled Event Handlers**
Video events like `timeupdate` and `progress` fire very frequently (multiple times per second) and were calling `forceStateSync` on every event without throttling.

## Solutions Applied

### 1. **Removed State Change Watchers**
```javascript
// BEFORE: Multiple useEffect hooks watching playerState changes
useEffect(() => {
  setTimeout(() => forceStateSync('playerstate-change-isPlaying'), 50);
}, [playerState.isPlaying, forceStateSync]);

// AFTER: Removed all state watchers
// State changes are already handled by video events and continuous sync
```

**Rationale**: The video element events already trigger syncs when state changes. Watching the state and syncing again creates redundant updates and infinite loops.

### 2. **Reduced Continuous Sync Frequency**
```javascript
// BEFORE: Sync every 100ms
setInterval(() => {
  forceStateSync('continuous-intelligent-sync');
}, 100);

// AFTER: Sync every 500ms and skip during playback start
setInterval(() => {
  if (!playbackStartProtectionRef.current) {
    forceStateSync('continuous-intelligent-sync');
  }
}, 500);
```

**Rationale**: 100ms is too aggressive and causes excessive renders. 500ms is sufficient for keeping state in sync while reducing CPU usage.

### 3. **Throttled High-Frequency Event Handlers**
```javascript
// BEFORE: Sync on every timeupdate event (fires ~4 times per second)
const handleTimeUpdate = () => {
  forceStateSync('video-event-timeupdate');
};

// AFTER: Throttle to max once per 250ms
const handleTimeUpdate = () => {
  const now = Date.now();
  if (now - lastSyncTimestamp.current < 250) {
    return;
  }
  forceStateSync('video-event-timeupdate');
};
```

**Rationale**: `timeupdate` and `progress` events fire very frequently. Throttling them reduces render cycles while maintaining responsive UI updates.

## Expected Results

After these fixes:
1. ✅ No more infinite render loops
2. ✅ HLS instance created once and reused
3. ✅ Reduced CPU usage and smoother playback
4. ✅ Video ref remains stable
5. ✅ State updates only when necessary

## Testing Recommendations

1. Load a video and verify it plays without constant re-initialization
2. Check browser console - should see minimal "Video setup effect triggered" messages
3. Monitor CPU usage - should be significantly lower
4. Test controls (play/pause, seek, volume) - should work smoothly
5. Check that timeline updates properly during playback

## Additional Notes

The 403 Forbidden error from the stream proxy is a separate issue related to:
- CORS headers
- Referrer policy
- Stream URL expiration
- Rate limiting

This should be investigated separately from the render loop issue.
