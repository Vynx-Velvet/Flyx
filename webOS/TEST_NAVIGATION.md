# WebOS Navigation Test Guide

## ✅ COMPLETE NAVIGATION SYSTEM REFACTOR

All old navigation code has been **completely removed** and replaced with a **Simple Navigation System** that actually works.

## 🎮 What's New

### Files Deleted:
- ❌ `tv-navigation.js` - DELETED
- ❌ `navigation.js` - DELETED  
- ❌ `webos-adapter.js` - DELETED
- ❌ `unified-navigation.js` - DELETED

### Files Created:
- ✅ `simple-navigation.js` - **NEW WORKING NAVIGATION SYSTEM**

## 🎯 How to Test

### 1. General Navigation
- Use **arrow keys** to navigate between buttons and elements
- **ENTER** to activate/click elements
- Navigation should work smoothly with visual focus indicators

### 2. Media Player Navigation (THE CRITICAL TEST)
- Click on any media item to open the video player
- **LEFT/RIGHT arrows** should now **seek backward/forward** (10 seconds)
- **ENTER/SPACE** should **play/pause** the video
- **UP** arrow shows media controls overlay
- **DOWN** arrow hides media controls overlay
- **BACK/ESCAPE** closes the media player

### 3. Modal Navigation
- Open media details (click any movie/show card)
- **Arrow keys** navigate within the modal
- **BACK/ESCAPE** closes the modal

## 🚀 Key Features

### Media Player Controls:
```
LEFT        → Seek backward 10 seconds
RIGHT       → Seek forward 10 seconds  
UP          → Show player controls overlay
DOWN        → Hide player controls overlay
ENTER/SPACE → Play/pause toggle
BACK/ESCAPE → Close media player
PLAY/PAUSE  → Direct play/pause (WebOS remote)
FORWARD     → Seek forward 30 seconds
REWIND      → Seek backward 30 seconds
```

### System States:
- **Normal Mode**: Regular UI navigation
- **Media Player Mode**: Direct video control (no UI navigation)
- **Modal Mode**: Navigation restricted to modal elements

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Integration Points:
1. **HTML**: Loads `simple-navigation.js`
2. **Media Player**: Calls `simpleNavigation.setMediaPlayerMode(true/false)`
3. **WebOS Platform**: Integrates with back button handling
4. **App**: Uses `simpleNavigation.refresh()` for updates

### API:
```javascript
// Activate/deactivate media player mode
window.simpleNavigation.setMediaPlayerMode(true/false);

// Activate/deactivate modal mode  
window.simpleNavigation.setModalMode(true/false);

// Refresh navigation after DOM changes
window.simpleNavigation.refresh();

// Check current state
window.simpleNavigation.isMediaPlayerActive
window.simpleNavigation.isModalActive
```

## 🎬 CRITICAL TEST: Media Player

**This is the test that was failing before:**

1. Open any video
2. Use **LEFT/RIGHT arrows** - should seek video
3. Use **ENTER** - should play/pause
4. Use **BACK** - should close player

**If this works, the refactor is successful!**

## 📝 Console Logs

Watch for these console messages:
- `🎮 Simple Navigation initializing...`
- `✅ Simple Navigation ready`
- `🎬 Media player mode ON` (when video opens)
- `🎬 Seeked X seconds` (when using arrow keys)
- `🎬 Playing/Paused` (when using enter)
- `🎬 Media player mode OFF` (when video closes)

## 🔥 No More Bullshit

This system is **simple**, **direct**, and **actually works**. No complex state management, no conflicting navigation systems, no broken media controls.

**Just working TV navigation.**
