# Media Player Episode Navigation & Subtitle Fix Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented episode navigation controls and fixed the subtitle switching issue that was causing video reloads.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Episode Navigation
- **Next/Previous Episode Buttons**: Added intuitive navigation controls for TV shows
- **Current Episode Display**: Shows current episode number and name
- **Smart Navigation**: Automatically detects available episodes and disables buttons when at boundaries
- **Episode Information**: Displays episode titles and numbers for context

### 2. Subtitle Fix
- **No Video Reload**: Subtitle changes no longer cause the video to restart from the beginning
- **State Preservation**: Video playback position and play/pause state are maintained during subtitle switches
- **Seamless Switching**: Users can change subtitles without interrupting their viewing experience

## Technical Implementation

### New Components Created

#### `useEpisodeNavigation.js` Hook
- Fetches episode list for the current season
- Provides navigation functions (`goToNextEpisode`, `goToPreviousEpisode`)
- Tracks current episode position and availability of next/previous episodes
- Handles episode data and navigation state

#### `EpisodeNavigation.js` Component
- Renders previous/next episode buttons with episode information
- Shows current episode number and name
- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes
- Disabled state handling for boundary episodes

#### API Endpoint
- Created `/api/tmdb/tv/[movieId]/season/[seasonId]/route.js` for episode data fetching
- Integrates with existing TMDB API structure

### Key Fixes

#### Subtitle Reload Issue
**Problem**: Changing subtitles caused the entire video to reload and reset to the beginning.

**Solution**: 
1. Removed `activeSubtitle` dependency from `useHlsWithPerformance` hook
2. Created `handleSubtitleChange` function that preserves video state
3. Stores current playback time and play state before subtitle change
4. Restores video position and playback state after subtitle processing

#### HLS Hook Optimization
```javascript
// Before: Video reloaded on subtitle change
}, [streamUrl, streamType, activeSubtitle]);

// After: Video only reloads on stream changes
}, [streamUrl, streamType]); // Removed activeSubtitle dependency
```

#### State Preservation
```javascript
const handleSubtitleChange = useCallback((subtitle) => {
  // Store current video state
  const currentTime = videoRef.current?.currentTime || 0;
  const wasPlaying = !videoRef.current?.paused;
  
  // Change subtitle without affecting video
  selectSubtitle(subtitle).then(() => {
    // Restore video state
    if (videoRef.current && currentTime > 0) {
      videoRef.current.currentTime = currentTime;
      if (wasPlaying) {
        videoRef.current.play().catch(console.error);
      }
    }
  });
}, [selectSubtitle]);
```

### UI/UX Improvements

#### Episode Navigation Controls
- **Position**: Floating above main controls, centered
- **Design**: Modern glass-morphism style with backdrop blur
- **Responsiveness**: Adapts to mobile devices with simplified layout
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and disabled states

#### Visual Design
- Consistent with existing media player styling
- Auto-hiding behavior matches main controls
- Smooth transitions and hover effects
- Clear visual hierarchy with episode information

### CSS Styling
Added comprehensive responsive styles:
- Desktop: Full episode information with titles
- Tablet: Reduced spacing and smaller text
- Mobile: Icon-only buttons with essential information

## Integration Points

### ShowDetails Component
- Added `handleEpisodeChange` function to manage episode transitions
- Integrated with existing episode selection state
- Maintains consistency with current UI patterns

### UniversalMediaPlayer Component
- Added episode navigation props and handlers
- Integrated episode navigation component
- Fixed subtitle handling to prevent video reloads

## Benefits

### User Experience
1. **Seamless Episode Navigation**: Users can easily move between episodes without leaving the player
2. **Uninterrupted Subtitle Changes**: No more video restarts when changing subtitle languages
3. **Better Control**: Clear indication of current episode and navigation availability
4. **Responsive Design**: Works well on all device sizes

### Technical Benefits
1. **Performance**: Reduced unnecessary video reloads improve loading times
2. **State Management**: Better separation of concerns between video and subtitle state
3. **Maintainability**: Clean, modular code structure
4. **Extensibility**: Easy to add more navigation features in the future

## Usage

### For TV Shows
- Episode navigation automatically appears for TV content
- Previous/Next buttons show episode numbers and titles

3. **Auto-Play Next**: Automatically play next episode when current ends
4. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Hotkeys for episode navigation
5. **Episode Thumbnails**: Preview images for episodes

## Testing

The implementation has been tested for:
- ✅ Episode navigation functionality
