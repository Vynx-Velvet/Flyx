# Video Player Loading Fix

## Problem
The video player was stuck showing a spinning loading screen and never connecting with the shadowlands URL extraction response.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. **Missing Loading State Visibility**
- The initial loading screen (`AdaptiveLoading`) would disappear once `streamUrl` was available
- However, the video player itself had no visible loading indicator while HLS.js was initializing
- This created a "black screen" effect where users couldn't tell if the player was loading or broken

### 2. **Silent HLS Initialization Failures**
- HLS.js could fail to initialize without proper error handling
- No timeout mechanism to detect stuck initialization
- Video element readiness was not being checked before HLS attachment

### 3. **Insufficient Logging**
- Not enough diagnostic logging to track the stream loading flow
- Difficult to debug where the process was failing

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. **Added Video Loading Overlay** ✅
```javascript
{/* Video Loading Overlay - Shows while video is initializing */}
<AnimatePresence>
  {streamUrl && !isInitialized && (
    <motion.div className={styles.videoLoadingOverlay}>
      <div>Initializing Video Player...</div>
      <div>Loading HLS stream</div>
    </motion.div>
  )}
</AnimatePresence>
```

**Benefits:**
- Users now see a clear loading indicator while HLS is initializing
- Prevents confusion about whether the player is working
- Smooth animation transitions

### 2. **Added HLS Initialization Timeout** ✅
```javascript
// Set a timeout to detect if HLS is stuck
const hlsTimeout = setTimeout(() => {
  if (!isInitialized) {
    console.error('🚨 HLS TIMEOUT: Video failed to initialize within 30 seconds');
    setPlayerState(prev => ({
      ...prev,
      hasError: true,
      errorMessage: 'Video player initialization timeout. The stream may be unavailable or blocked.'
    }));
  }
}, 30000); // 30 second timeout
```

**Benefits:**
- Detects stuck initialization after 30 seconds
- Shows clear error message to user
- Allows retry functionality

### 3. **Video Element Readiness Check** ✅
```javascript
// Wait for video element to be ready
if (videoRef.current.readyState === 0) {
  console.log('⏳ Waiting for video element to be ready...');
  await new Promise((resolve) => {
    const checkReady = () => {
      if (videoRef.current && videoRef.current.readyState > 0) {
        console.log('✅ Video element is now ready');
        resolve();
      } else {
        setTimeout(checkReady, 100);
      }
    };
    checkReady();
  });
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Ensures video element is ready before HLS attachment
- Prevents race conditions
- More reliable initialization

### 4. **Enhanced Error Handling** ✅
```javascript
} catch (error) {
  console.error('HLS.js loading error:', error);
  setPlayerState(prev => ({
    ...prev,
    hasError: true,
    errorMessage: 'Failed to initialize HLS player: ' + error.message
  }));
  // Fallback to native playback
  try {
    videoRef.current.src = currentStreamUrl;
  } catch (fallbackError) {
    console.error('Native playback fallback also failed:', fallbackError);
  }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Catches and displays HLS initialization errors
- Attempts native playback fallback
- Provides clear error messages to users

### 5. **Comprehensive Diagnostic Logging** ✅
Added extensive logging throughout the stream loading process:
- Stream state updates
- HLS initialization steps
- Video element readiness
- Render conditions
- Error states

**Benefits:**
- Easy debugging of loading issues
- Clear visibility into the loading flow
- Helps identify bottlenecks

## Testing

### Test Page Created
Created `test-extraction.html` for isolated testing:
- Direct extraction API testing
- Stream URL validation
- HLS player initialization testing
- Error handling verification

### How to Test
1. Open `test-extraction.html` in a browser
2. Enter TMDB ID (e.g., 94605 for Arcane)
3. Enter season and episode (e.g., 1, 1)
4. Click "Test Extraction"
5. Verify:
   - ✅ Extraction completes successfully
   - ✅ Stream URL is returned
   - ✅ Video player loads and plays
   - ✅ Loading indicators show properly
   - ✅ Errors are handled gracefully

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Normal Flow:
1. User selects episode
2. `AdaptiveLoading` shows with progress (0-100%)
3. Stream URL is extracted
4. `AdaptiveLoading` disappears
5. **NEW:** Video loading overlay appears with spinner
6. HLS.js initializes and loads manifest
7. **NEW:** Video loading overlay disappears
8. Video starts playing

### Error Flow:
1. User selects episode
2. `AdaptiveLoading` shows with progress
3. Stream extraction fails OR HLS initialization fails
4. **NEW:** Clear error message is displayed
5. User can retry or go back

### Timeout Flow:
1. User selects episode
2. Stream URL is extracted successfully
3. HLS initialization starts
4. **NEW:** If no progress after 30 seconds, timeout error is shown
5. User can retry

## Files Modified
- `app/components/UniversalMediaPlayer/FuturisticMediaPlayer.js`
  - Added video loading overlay
  - Added HLS timeout detection
  - Added video element readiness check
  - Enhanced error handling
  - Added comprehensive logging

## Files Created
- `test-extraction.html` - Standalone test page for extraction and playback
- `VIDEO_PLAYER_LOADING_FIX.md` - This documentation

## Next Steps
1. Test with various shows and episodes
2. Monitor console logs for any remaining issues
3. Verify timeout handling works correctly
4. Test on different browsers and devices
5. Consider adding retry button in the loading overlay

## Notes
- The shadowlands extraction API is working correctly
- The stream proxy is functioning properly
- The issue was purely in the video player initialization and user feedback
- All fixes are non-breaking and backward compatible
